# [Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/file/cc7e2b878868cbae992d1fb743995d8f-Paper.pdf)

tl;dr: GAIL tries to learn the distribution of the expert's occupancy measure, using a GAN-style training method.

#### Overall impression
Compared with imitation learning, the GAIL can interact with the environment to adjust the learner policy.


#### Key ideas
- The occupancy measure is regarded as the similarity between expert policy and learner policy. The paper shows the occupancy measure matching is a dual of IRL
(Inverse Reinforcement Learning) method.
